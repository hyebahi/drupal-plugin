### Does this plugin help with GDPR or CCPA compliance?

This plugin integrates TrustArc’s Consent Management Platform (CMP) to facilitate compliance with regulations such as **GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, and others**. However, compliance depends on how the site owner configures consent settings, discloses data collection, and manages consent records.  

To ensure compliance, verify that:  
- Your consent banner is correctly configured within the TrustArc CMP dashboard.  
- Your website’s privacy policy reflects your use of the CMP.  
- You regularly review your consent settings to align with privacy laws.
- You implement necessary mechanisms, such as Tag Manager or other consent-aware tools, to ensure that tracking scripts and third-party services respect users' preferences.
